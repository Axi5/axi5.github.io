        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Designer - 5 Years at RT Software</h3>
        <p>My role as a Designer at RT Software has been to design, implement and develop graphics for broadcast companies all over the world including the BBC, Sky and more. I had the chance to be working with technologies such as Unreal Engine, Blender, Maya and the Adobe Creative Suite. A big part of the job was to implement data logic in Ruby, or write shaders in CgFX. I also had the opportunity to travel across the world to deliver training sessions to people who had bought our software.</p>
        <h3>Programmer - 1 Year at RT Software</h3>
        <p>I have been officially working as a programmer at RT Software for a year, however I did work with scripting languages such as Javascript and Ruby during my time as a designer too. My tasks have been to do general bug fixing as well as expanding our web technologies in both frontend and backend. The languages I have been writing have mostly been C++ for server and Javascript for frontend, I have also been working with libraries such as Qt/QML, libwebsocket, JsonCpp and investigating web frameworks such as Angular & React.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>2011-2015 - BA Hons Game Art <span class="accent">|</span> University of South Wales</h3>
        <p>I studied for 4 years at University of South Wales, the first two years were spent studying Film and Television. After 2 years I realised I spent a lot of my personal time programming games & making game art and chose to switch courses and graduate as a Game Artist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hobbies">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Before I was creating games, I was creating websites and ran a small 3D tutorial website for Cinema4D users. This
            also makes me familiar with HTML, PHP, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <p>I enjoy visiting Siggraph London events where I can meet and enjoy a beer with VFX artists, tools and graphics
            developers. Keeping up with industry techniques and development satisfies my curiosity and inspires me to create
            more.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy playing guitar in my spare time.</p>
